								<h2 class="major">About AydoCorp</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/AydoOffice1.png" alt="AydoCorp Office" /></span>
								<h3>Background</h3>
								<p>Based in the Ellis system on the planet Green, the Aydo Intergalactic Corporation (more commonly referred to as "AydoCorp") is an amalgamation of not only several companies within the system but also containing subsidiaries in a multitude of other systems. Aptly named due to its headquarters located in the city of Aydo, the corporation had its humble beginnings as a small one-man delivery company run by none other than the current CEO, Christoff Revan. Over the years the company would grow and expand, what was once known as "Aydo City Delivery" eventually became "Aydo Amalgamated Industries" after a merger with Seahorse Fisheries, based out of Neo Taurii on Kampos. After acquiring multiple subsidiaries and having greater expansions, the company would transform into the corporation we now know as "AydoCorp", serving many clients throughout human and alien space.</p>
								<h3>Our Members</h3>
								<p>While the in-game lore may be all very fine and well, it is the players of the very real organization that matter the most. Some communities, not just in this game but ANY game, end up devolving into incoherency and tedium due to inflexible management, as well as the pure burn-out of the members. Here in this organization we want to deviate from this as best as we can, and in doing so create a positive, beneficial environment for all members. At the end of the day, this IS a videogame and a form of entertainment, so while it is great to create events and structure, we don't want members to feel overly stifled. However, what we have found is that some form of direction and leadership, and in that sense a form of control, is also necessary to create a focused goal for people to follow. Without this control and planning everything would fall apart, and that's where the org comes in: AydoCorp is there to bring people together for a similar goal, a love for video-gaming in general but also a love for science-fiction and a desire for more complex, meaningful gameplay. Star Citizen really scratches that itch for most of us, and as the CEO always says, "it's better to play together".</p>
								<h3>Our Focus</h3>
								<p>As AydoCorp's focus is on logistics, most of our members will generally gravitate to such activities that relate to that. That being said, the game is still many years away from being at a released, or even beta, state; there's a lot of gameplay mechanics that just aren't in the game yet and as such don't allow us to fully pursue the logistics gameplay loop. As such, until the game is fleshed out enough to where we can reliably and effectively conduct logistical gameplay in a tangible, meaningful way, we encourage all sorts of gameplay for our members. So, even if you aren't necessarily enthused about logistics and enjoy things like combative gameplay, racing, or anything else then the org can still be a good fit for you! While we are casual org, we still provide options for structured gameplay, and even have our own racing team, so if you're interested in being part of a group of people that are focused and know what they're doing then we can certainly offer that.</p>

											<h2>AydoExpress</h2>
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/Aydo_Express.png" alt="AydoExpress Operations" /></span>
											<p>The bread and butter of the organization, AydoExpress deals with cargo hauling and personnel transport. Gameplay offered are things like trading, deliveries, transport, and really just hauling anything in general that the organization needs. As the game gets more complex, this gameplay will become more and more important, with it also being more engaging and purposeful. To keep the organization working smoothly we will need the help of everyone in AydoExpress, without them there would be no movement of people and resources and operations would be at a halt.</p>
											<p>Another thing to keep in consideration is that this subsidiary is meant to be the face of the organization as it conducts the lion's share of external services to other organizations and individual players, whereas the others are almost purely internal services. This does not make the other subsidiaries any less important, as none of the subsidiaries could survive without each other; however, if you enjoy such logistical gameplay and/or like working behind-the-scenes and knowing that what you do ensures that the organization can keep functioning, then please consider AydoExpress!</p>
											<p>If you'd like to know more, please contact the current interim director, <a href="#contact">@UdonMan</a>, for more information!</p>

											<h2>Empyrion Industries</h2>

											<p>Keeping the coffers full, Empyrion Industries deals with industrial gameplay to sustain the organization with resources and a great deal of profits. Gameplay offered are things like mining and salvaging operations, as well as refueling. The operations that this subsidiary carries out are meant to help drive the greatest amount of income for the organization, in addition to providing the resources for the rest of the subsidiaries to take advantage of.</p>
											<p>When things like refining, full manual repair, engineering, and more come to the game there will be many more endeavors to be a part of with this subsidiary.</p>
