# 500 Error Fix - Update

## Issue Description

The application was still experiencing 500 errors after the initial fixes. Upon further investigation, it was determined that the 500 errors were occurring because:

1. The client was making requests to API endpoints that didn't exist in the server
2. The server didn't have proper error handling for undefined routes

## Changes Made

Several additional fixes have been implemented:

### 1. Added Missing API Endpoints

Based on the proxy logs, we identified that the client was trying to access two endpoints that didn't exist:

- Added a health check endpoint at `/api/health-check`
- Added a test post endpoint at `/api/test-post`

These endpoints now return proper responses instead of 500 errors.

### 2. Improved Error Handling for Undefined Routes

Added a catch-all route handler for undefined API routes that returns a 404 error with a descriptive message. This prevents 500 errors for undefined routes and provides a more appropriate response to the client.

```javascript
// Catch-all route for undefined API routes
app.all('/api/*', (req, res) => {
  res.status(404).json({ 
    message: 'API endpoint not found',
    path: req.originalUrl,
    method: req.method
  });
});
```

### 3. Enhanced Test Script

Updated the test-api.js script to include tests for:
- The new health check endpoint
- The new test post endpoint
- A non-existent endpoint to verify 404 handling

## How to Test the Changes

1. Restart the Node.js server:
   ```
   cd nodejs/aydocorp-api
   npm restart
   ```

2. Run the updated test script to verify the API is working:
   ```
   node test-api.js
   ```

3. Check the browser to verify that the 500 error is resolved.

## Explanation

The 500 errors were occurring because the client was making requests to endpoints that didn't exist in the API. When a request was made to an undefined endpoint, the server would try to process it but couldn't find a matching route handler, resulting in a 500 error.

By adding the missing endpoints and a catch-all route handler, we've ensured that all requests receive a proper response, even if the endpoint doesn't exist. This prevents the 500 errors and provides a more user-friendly experience.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always implement proper error handling for undefined routes
2. Monitor API requests to identify any endpoints that clients are trying to access but don't exist
3. Implement a health check endpoint to verify that the API is running correctly
4. Use the test script regularly to ensure all endpoints are working as expected
5. Keep the client and server in sync to ensure they're using the same API endpoints
