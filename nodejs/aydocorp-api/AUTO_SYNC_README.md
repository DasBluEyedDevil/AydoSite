# Automatic Data Synchronization - Removed

## Important Notice

The automatic data synchronization feature that used Google Sheets and Google Docs has been removed as per requirements. This decision was made because the Google API approach to updating the website was not working properly and was deemed to be a poor approach for the website's needs.

## What Has Been Removed

The following functionality has been removed from the application:

1. **Scheduled Sync Jobs**: The background jobs that periodically synced data with Google APIs
2. **Google Sheets Integration**: The ability to sync employee data with Google Sheets
3. **Google Docs Integration**: The ability to sync operations, career paths, and events with Google Docs
4. **Manual Sync Endpoints**: The API endpoints that allowed manual triggering of data synchronization

## Current Data Management

All data is now managed directly through the application's database. To update content:

1. Use the application's user interface
2. Use the API endpoints with proper authentication

There is no longer any automatic synchronization with external data sources.

## Questions

If you have any questions about this change or need assistance with data management, please contact the system administrator.
