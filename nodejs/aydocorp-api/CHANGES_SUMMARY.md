# Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to the AydoCorp API to address the issues described in the requirements.

## Issues Addressed

1. **404 Error for sync.html**: The sync.html page was not accessible at http://www.aydocorp.space/sync.html, resulting in a 404 error.
2. **Sync Timing**: The autosync timings needed to be reduced to 5 minutes for each sheet.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Sync Schedule

Modified the scheduler.js file to change all sync timings from hours to 5 minutes:

- **Employee Sync**: Changed from hourly to every 5 minutes
- **Career Path Sync**: Changed from every 2 hours to every 5 minutes
- **Event Sync**: Changed from every 3 hours to every 5 minutes
- **Operation Sync**: Changed from every 4 hours to every 5 minutes

Updated all related log messages to reflect the new schedule.

### 2. Updated Documentation

Updated the following files to reflect the new sync schedule:

- **sync.html**: Updated the "About Auto Sync" section to show the new 5-minute schedule
- **AUTO_SYNC_README.md**: Updated all references to the sync schedule, including the code examples and log messages

### 3. Apache Configuration

Created a deployment guide (DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) with detailed instructions on how to configure Apache to properly serve the sync.html file. The guide includes two options:

1. **Use Apache as a Reverse Proxy**: Configure Apache to forward all requests to the Node.js application
2. **Copy Static Files to Apache's Document Root**: Configure Apache to serve the static files directly

### 4. Added .htaccess File

Added a .htaccess file to the public directory that can be used to configure Apache to properly route requests to the Node.js application.

## Files Modified

3. **AUTO_SYNC_README.md**: Updated all references to the sync schedule
