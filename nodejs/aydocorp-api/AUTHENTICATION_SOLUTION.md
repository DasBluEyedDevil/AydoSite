# Authentication Solution for API Endpoints

## Issue Summary

The error message `{"message":"No token, authorization denied"}` occurs when trying to access protected API endpoints like `/api/employee-portal/operations` without providing the necessary authentication token.

## Solution Implemented

I've created a comprehensive set of resources to help you understand and resolve this authentication issue:

1. **API Authentication README** (`API_AUTHENTICATION_README.md`)
   - Explains the authentication issue in detail
   - Provides step-by-step instructions for obtaining and using JWT tokens
   - Lists common authentication issues and their solutions

2. **Test Scripts**:
   - **Node.js Script** (`test-operations-auth.js`)
     - A JavaScript example using axios to authenticate and access the operations endpoint
     - Shows both authentication methods (Bearer token and x-auth-token)
     - Displays equivalent curl commands

   - **Bash Script** (`test-operations-auth.sh`)
     - A shell script example for Linux/Mac users
     - Uses curl to authenticate and access the operations endpoint
     - Includes error handling and clear output

   - **Windows Batch Script** (`test-operations-auth.bat`)
     - A batch file example specifically for Windows users
     - Uses curl to authenticate and access the operations endpoint
     - Saves responses to files for easy inspection

## How to Use These Resources

1. First, read the `API_AUTHENTICATION_README.md` to understand the authentication process.

2. Choose the appropriate test script for your platform:
   - Windows users: Use `test-operations-auth.bat`
   - Linux/Mac users: Use `test-operations-auth.sh`
   - Node.js developers: Use `test-operations-auth.js`

3. Edit the script to add your actual username and password.

4. Run the script to see a complete example of authentication and API access.

5. Once you understand how authentication works, you can apply the same principles to your own API requests.

## Key Points to Remember

1. All employee portal endpoints require authentication.

2. You must first obtain a JWT token by logging in through the `/api/auth/login` endpoint.

3. You can include the token in your requests using either:
   - The Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token`
   - The x-auth-token header: `x-auth-token: your-jwt-token`

4. JWT tokens expire after 7 days, so you'll need to log in again if your token expires.

5. For more details on the API and authentication, refer to the [Google Integration Guide](./GOOGLE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md#authentication).

## Conclusion

The "No token, authorization denied" error is not a bug but a security feature that ensures only authenticated users can access sensitive API endpoints. By following the authentication process described in these resources, you should be able to successfully access the operations endpoint and other protected resources.
