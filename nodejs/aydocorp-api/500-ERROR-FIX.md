# 500 Error Fix

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing 500 errors, which could be caused by:
1. A bad entry in the .htaccess file
2. PHP/code errors in the application

## Changes Made

Several issues were identified and fixed:

### 1. Fixed package.json Syntax Error

The package.json file had a syntax error that was preventing npm from properly installing dependencies:
- Removed duplicate "express-rate-limit" entry
- Added missing closing brace after dependencies section
- Fixed JSON syntax

### 2. Fixed Logger Import Issue in server.js

The logger was being imported after it was used in the error handling middleware:
- Moved the logger import to the top of the file
- Removed the duplicate import

### 3. Improved Error Handling in .htaccess

The .htaccess file was missing a custom error document for 500 errors:
- Added a custom error document for 500 errors
- Created a user-friendly 503.html error page

### 4. Enhanced Logger Implementation

The logger implementation was improved to handle permission issues gracefully:
- Added checks for logs directory accessibility
- Added fallback to console logging if log files are not accessible
- Prevented application crashes due to logging errors

### 5. Improved Test Script

The test-api.js script was enhanced to be more flexible:
- Added support for testing against different hosts using the API_HOST environment variable

## How to Test the Changes

1. Restart the Node.js server:
   ```
   cd nodejs/aydocorp-api
   npm restart
   ```

2. Run the test script to verify the API is working:
   ```
   node test-api.js
   ```

3. If you want to test against a different host, set the API_HOST environment variable:
   ```
   # Linux/Mac
   API_HOST=your-server-ip node test-api.js
   
   # Windows
   set API_HOST=your-server-ip
   node test-api.js
   ```

4. Check the browser to verify that the 500 error is resolved.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter 500 errors:

1. Check the logs directory for error logs:
   ```
   cd nodejs/aydocorp-api/logs
   cat error.log
   ```

2. If the logs directory doesn't exist or isn't accessible, check the console output for errors.

3. Verify that the Node.js server is running:
   ```
   ps aux | grep node
   ```

4. Check if the port is in use:
   ```
   netstat -tuln | grep 8080
   ```

5. If all else fails, try restarting the server with debugging enabled:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=development npm start
   ```

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always validate JSON files before committing changes
2. Use a linter to catch syntax errors
3. Implement proper error handling throughout the application
4. Regularly test the application with the test script
5. Monitor the logs for errors
